# Awaaz Music Service

Design the SQL schema for a music streaming service called Awaaz.

### The schema design should satisfy the following constraints:

- An artist has a `name`, `date of birth`.
- An artist can have many albums
- An album has a `name` and a `release date`.
- An album can have many songs
- A song has a `name`, `length`

Create a file called `awaaz-music-streaming.sql` that contains the schema.

### Questions I should be able to answer with the design:

- How many artists are in the system?
- How many albums does an artist have?
- How many artists released an album after the year 2008?
- How many artists have songs that are longer than 10 minutes?
